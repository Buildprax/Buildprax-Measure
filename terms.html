            agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you may not use the Service.
        </p>

        <h2>2. License and Use</h2>
        <p>
            We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use the Service for your

        <h2>3. Free Trial and Subscriptions</h2>
        <p>
            The Service may be offered with a free trial period. After the trial, continued access may require a paid

        </p>
        <p>
            Subscription terms, pricing, and renewals are disclosed at the time of purchase and may change from time to

        </ul>

        <h2>6. Data and Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            The Service stores project data locally on your device. We do not access or upload your files unless you
            explicitly share them for support. Our privacy practices are described in the Privacy Policy.

        <h2>7. Support</h2>
        <p>

            availability from time to time.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
            The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, whether express or
            implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
            purpose, and non-infringement.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>

            To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
            consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or data, arising from your use of the Service.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
