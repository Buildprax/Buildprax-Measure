        <h2>Device Identification and Licensing</h2>
        <p>
            Buildprax Measure Pro uses a locally generated device identifier (hardware fingerprint) for licensing 
            and trial management purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            This identifier is created and stored on the user's device. The device identifier is generated and used locally and is not transmitted to our servers. It is used only to:

            <li>Manage trial periods</li>
            <li>Validate subscription licenses</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            No drawings, project data, or measurement information are transmitted to external servers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application does not collect personal data for advertising, profiling, or analytics purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Project files, drawings, and measurements remain on the user's device and are not uploaded by Buildprax Measure Pro.
